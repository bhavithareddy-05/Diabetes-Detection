# Diabetes-Detection

This project demonstrates the usage of various machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes based on several health parameters. The project includes synthetic data generation and implementations of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier.
Collaborated Project with https://github.com/Sanath-3946
